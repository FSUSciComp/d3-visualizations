<h1> The Heat Equation </h1>
<p>
$\bf{Test}$
In this example we will be solving a parabolic PDE, the heat equation, in 1D:
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}=\alpha\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial
x^{2}},$$where $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity coefficient. An example of where this would be used would be to determine
how the temperature $U(x,t)$ within a material changed with time.  For
this example we will imagine that the ends of the material are being
cooled to keep them at some fixed
temperature.  In this case we will unrealistically cool the endpoints to
zero.  This gives us the boundary conditions
$U(\frac{-L}{2},t)=U(\frac{L}{2},t)=0$. The temperature profile that we
will begin with is a gaussian. The gaussian is the the steady state
solution
that results from
heating the center of the material, holding it at some constant temperature
$T$. For this example $T(0,0)=1$. 
</p>
<p>
$\textbf{Choosing a Numerical Scheme}$
</p>
<p>
We need to choose two numerical schemes to solve this PDE. First, we
need to decide on how we are going to estimate the second spacial
derivative of $U.$ For this problem I'm choosing $2^{nd}$ order central
difference:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial{x^{2}}}_{i}\approx\frac{U_{i-1}-2U_{i}+U_{i+1}}{\Delta
x^{2}}.$$
Now we need to decide how to step forward in time. An obvious choice
for this is simple Forward Euler: $$U(x,t+\Delta t)\approx
U(x,t)+\dot{U}(x,t)\Delta t$$
where $\dot{U}$ is the first time derivative of $U$ which we have an
expression for from the PDE that we aim to satisfy. Plugging in our
approximation for the second derivative we can see the iterative scheme
takes shape:
$$U_{x_{i},t+1}=U_{x_{i},t}+\alpha \left(\frac{U_{x_{i-1},t}-2U_{x_{i},t}+U_{x_{i+1},t}}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)\Delta t.$$ 
It's clear to see that the LHS is calculated only from $U$ from the
previous timestep. This means we can simply step forward through time
if we always save what $U$ was from the last step and iterate over it.
