<h1> The Heat Equation </h1>
<p>
In this example we will be solving a parabolic PDE, the heat equation, in 1D:
$$\frac{\partial U}{\partial t}=\alpha\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial
x^{2}},$$where $\alpha$ is the thermal diffusivity coefficient. An example of where this would be used would be to determine
how the temperature $U(x,t)$ within a material changed with time.  For
this example we will imagine that the ends of the material are being
cooled to keep them at some fixed
temperature.  In this case we will unrealistically cool the endpoints to
zero.  This gives us the boundary conditions
$U(\frac{-L}{2},t)=U(\frac{L}{2},t)=0$. The temperature profile that we
will begin with is a gaussian. The gaussian is the the steady state
solution
that results from
heating the center of the material, holding it at some constant temperature
$T$. For this example $T(0,0)=1$ giving us an analytic solution for the
temperature profile at any time in the future:
$$U(x,t)=\frac{1}{\sqrt{1+4t}}e^{\left(\frac{-x^{2}}{1+4t}\right)}$$
Our goal is to approximate what the
temperature profile of the material will be one second into the
future.
</p>
<p>
$\textbf{Choosing a Numerical Scheme}$
</p>
<p>
We'll choose two numerical schemes to explore in solving this PDE. First, we
need to decide on how we are going to estimate the second spacial
derivative of $U.$ For this problem I'm choosing $2^{nd}$ order central
difference:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial{x^{2}}}_{i}\approx\frac{U_{i-1}-2U_{i}+U_{i+1}}{\Delta
x^{2}}.$$
This formula comes from combing the Taylor series expansion for
$U(x+\Delta x)$ and $U(x-\Delta x)$. This is considered $2^{nd}$ order
because of the first term truncated from the approximation:
$$\frac{\partial^{2}U}{\partial{x^{2}}}_{i}\approx\frac{U_{i-1}-2U_{i}+U_{i+1}}{\Delta
x^{2}}-\frac{\Delta x^{2}}{4!} U_{xxxx}+\ldots$$
We can now say we know something about the error from the spatial
derivative approximation, $\epsilon_{x}=\beta\Delta x^{2}$,
where $\beta$ is a constant that's dependent on the
fourth spatial derivative of the solution.
It's important to know this information because we can use this
knowledge to verify that our numerical scheme is executing correctly.
We can verify this by looking at the log of the error of our numerical
solution (to do this it's useful to know the exact solution to calculate
the error, although, there are other methods to verify the order of a
model).
$$\log(\epsilon)=\log(\epsilon_{x})=\log(\beta)+2\log(\Delta x)$$
If you think about plotting this function you can see that it's the
equation of a line, if plotted on a log scale, with a slope of 2.
Therefore, if we plot the log of $\Delta x$ vs the log of the error on a
log scale we expect to see a line of slope 2. If we do not then we have
implemented our numerical scheme incorrectly.
</p>
<p>
$\textbf{Stepping in Time}$
</p>
<p>Now we need to decide how to step forward in time to determine what
the temperature profile is one second into the future. An obvious choice
for this is simple Forward Euler: $$U(x,t+\Delta t)\approx
U(x,t)+\dot{U}(x,t)\Delta t$$
where $\dot{U}$ is the first time derivative of $U$ which we have an
expression for from the PDE that we aim to satisfy. This
formula comes from truncating the Taylor series expansion in
time and comes with an error with leading term $\epsilon_{t}\approx \frac{\Delta
t^{2}}{2!}\ddot{y}.$ This means that our original error expression is
incorrect and now must include the error due to the time
stepping approximation; $\epsilon = \epsilon_{x} + \epsilon_{t}.$
(We will have to deal with this later to understand what is
produced from the spatial convergence test.)
Now, plugging in our
approximation for the second derivative we can see the iterative scheme
takes shape:
$$U_{x_{i},t+1}=U_{x_{i},t}+\alpha \left(\frac{U_{x_{i-1},t}-2U_{x_{i},t}+U_{x_{i+1},t}}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)\Delta t.$$ 
It's clear to see that the LHS is calculated only from $U$ from the
previous timestep. This means we can simply step forward through time
if we always save what $U$ was from the last step and iterate over it.
Thinking about the fact that we are stepping forward with every step
gives us a simple approach to investigate stability. If we write out the
first two iterations of FE it should be clear what conditions need to be
satisfied for stability.
For the first iteration we have:
$$U_{1}^{i}=U_{0}^{i}+\alpha\left(\frac{U_{0}^{i-1}-2U_{0}^{i}+U_{0}^{i+1}}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)\Delta t=\left(1-\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)U_{0}^{i}+\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}(U_{0}^{i-1}+U_{0}^{i+1}),$$
taking another step we can see that the solution at any point in time
will be dependent on the initial condition
$$U_{2}^{i}=\left(1-\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)U_{1}^{i}+\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}(U_{1}^{i-1}+U_{1}^{i+1})\approx\left(1-\frac{2\alpha\Delta
t}{\Delta x^{2}}\right)^{2}U_{0}^{i}.$$
This leads us to an expression for the leading term of the solution at
the $n^{th}$ timestep:
$$U_{n}^{i}\approx\left(1-\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)^{n}U_{0}^{i}.$$
It's clear to see that if $\left|\left(1-\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)^{n}\right|>1$ our solution will
grow exponentially. Since $\Delta t$ and $\alpha$ will always be
positive our stability condition is$$\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\leq1.$$ 
</p>
<p>
Luckily there are other time stepping schemes that are more stable but
also come with their own numerical quirks. The other stencil we will
explore is the implicit scheme Backward Euler where we solve the time
reversed problem from one timestep ahead:
$$U_{x_{i},t+1}-\dot{U}_{x_{i},t+1}\Delta t=U_{x_{i},t},$$
now putting in our expression for the second derivative we arrive at
$$-\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}U_{x_{i-1},t+1}+\left(1+\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}\right)U_{x_{i},t+1}-\frac{\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}U_{x_{i+1},t+1}=U_{x_{i},t}.$$
Since we were just talking about stability let's look at the stability
of this scheme. Using the same logic as before, focusing on the index
$i$ and dropping lower order terms, we see:
$$U_{x_{i},t+1}\sim\left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}}\right)U_{x_{i},t}$$
then extending it to any point in the future:
$$U_{x_{i},t+n}\sim\left(\frac{1}{1+\frac{2\alpha\Delta t}{\Delta
x^{2}}}\right)^{n}U_{x_{i},t}$$
we can see that for this algorithm to be unstable the term in the
denominator would have to be less than one. Since $\alpha \gt 0$
as well as $\Delta x$ and
$\Delta t$ Backward Euler will always be stable. So why not just use BE
if it is always stable? Well, if we rearrange our expression from
earlier 
$$-U_{x_{i-1},t+1}+\left(\frac{\Delta
x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta
t}+2\right)U_{x_{i},t+1}-U_{x_{i+1},t+1}=\frac{\Delta
x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta t}U_{x_{i},t}.$$
This gives us a system of coupled equations that we need to solve
together; this is the key characteristic of an implicit method. It's much easier to see how to solve this if we express this as a matrix
equation
$$\left[\begin{array}{ccccccc}
1 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & \dots & 0\\
-1 & \frac{\Delta x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta t}+2 & -1 & 0 & 0 & \ddots & 0\\
0 & -1 & \frac{\Delta x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta t}+2 & -1 & \ddots & \ddots &
0\\
\vdots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \ddots & \vdots\\
0 & \ddots & \ddots & -1 & \frac{\Delta x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta t}+2 & -1 &
0\\
0 & \ddots & 0 & 0 & -1 & \frac{\Delta x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta t}+2 & -1\\
0 & \dots & 0 & 0 & 0 & 0 & 1
\end{array}\right]\left[\begin{array}{c}
U_{0,t+1}\\
U_{1,t+1}\\
U_{2,t+1}\\
\vdots\\
U_{N-2,t+1}\\
U_{N-1,t+1}\\
U_{N,t+1}
\end{array}\right]=\frac{\Delta x^{2}}{\alpha\Delta
t}\left[\begin{array}{c}
U_{0,t}\\
U_{1,t}\\
U_{2,t}\\
\vdots\\
U_{N-2,t}\\
U_{N-1,t}\\
U_{N,t}
\end{array}\right]$$

The first and last rows ensuring the boundary conditions. Technically
the first and last entry of the RHS should be multiplied by the
reciprocal of the term out front, but, since both those entries are
zero there is no need. This is an example of how to enforce Dirichlet
boundary conditions. If we do the row reduction operation of adding the
first row to the second and the last to the second to last we can reduce
the size of our problem from $N\times N$ to $N-2\times N-2$.
We now have a problem of the form $A\vec{x}=\vec{b}$ which has the
obvious solution of $\vec{x}=A^{-1}\vec{b}$. So we need to determine
$A^{-1}$ which can be done naively via Gaussian elimination but one
would prefer never to have to do that since it is an algorithm of
$\mathcal{O}\left(N^{3}\right)$. Instead we will solve the equation
iteratively using the Gauss-Seidel.
